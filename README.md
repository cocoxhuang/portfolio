## Work Experience
### Adjunct Professor @ Hunter College (_August 2020 - Present_)
- Instructor for courses including Statistics and Linear Algebra. Materials include experimental design, hypothesis test, dimension reduction, data science application, and [Python demonstrations](https://github.com/cocoxhuang/STAT213). An [example](https://github.com/cocoxhuang/STAT213/blob/main/chap10%20Hypothesis%20Testing%20Using%20a%20Single%20Sample.ipynb).

### Index Research Intern @ Nasdaq (_June 2016 - August 2016_)
- Provided support to internal cross-functional teams and external ETF fund managers through data collection, statistical analysis, and modeling, with a primary focus on summarizing index behaviors, including summary statistics and linear regression.
- Researched, developed, and presented the [Canada Dividend Achiever Index](https://indexes.nasdaqomx.com/Index/Overview/DACATR)  report including index description, calculation, evaluation, maintenance, and rebalancing, tailored for sales initiatives and investors' comprehensive analysis.

### Asset Management Intern @ Huatai Insurance (_June 2015 - August 2015_)
- Conducted research reports on investment opportunities in Fund of Funds (FoFs) for investment of funds.
- Contributed to the development and deployment of high-quality accounting automation to expedite delivery and improve efficiency.

## Projects
### GNN Predictive Modelling and Graph Data Mining
- Proposed a novel model integrating **graph discovery data mining** techniques and **Graph Neural Networks(GNNs)** to overcome limitations in graph structures for specific modeling tasks. By incorporating graph discovery models, the need for domain expertise in graph generation was also eliminated, resulting in significant time and effort savings compared to manual graph creation.
- It demonstrated a minimum of 15% improvement of the baseline Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and Neural Net models in a short-term intraday **Realized Volatility (RV)** prediction task by using 150 million records Limit Order Book (LOB) and trade data.

This is a network discovered using the [Glasso algorithm](https://jerryfriedman.su.domains/ftp/glasso-bio.pdf) from the [Kaggle Optiver Realized Volatility Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/optiver-realized-volatility-prediction) dataset.

### Graph Discovery Python Library
- Created [SmoothLaplacian](https://github.com/cocoxhuang/Smooth-Laplacian) Python network analysis library, facilitating efficient underlying network discovery of diverse data. This tool streamlined the process of extracting network features from complex datasets.
- It is a Python implementation of [Learning Laplacian Matrix in Smooth Graph Signal Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.7842.pdf)
